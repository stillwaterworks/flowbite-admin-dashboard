# SMB Forecasting Model

This project is a prototype script for forecasting sales and providing decision support for small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs). It uses a LightGBM model to predict future sales based on historical data and external factors like weather and local events.

## Features

*   **Sales Forecasting:** Predicts product sales for the next 7 days.
*   **Real-World Data Integration:** Ingests data from POS, weather, and event APIs (simulated in this prototype).
*   **Feature Engineering:** Creates features like day-of-week, holidays, and lag/rolling averages to improve model accuracy.
*   **Financial & Decision Support Tools:**
    *   **Purchasing Report:** Recommends purchase quantities and estimates costs.
    *   **Staffing Recommendations:** Suggests staffing levels based on projected revenue.
    *   **Cash Flow Projector:** Provides a 7-day financial outlook.
*   **Feedback and Improvement Loops:**
    *   **Model Retraining:** Allows for retraining the model with new data.
    *   **Waste Logging:** Captures data on unsold items.
    *   **Event Feedback:** Captures qualitative feedback on events.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses several Python libraries. You can install them using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy lightgbm scikit-learn holidays joblib
    ```

## Usage

To run the script, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python smb_forecasting_model.py
```

The script will perform the following actions:
1.  Ingest and process data.
2.  Train the sales forecasting model.
3.  Generate and display a 7-day sales forecast.
4.  Provide a purchasing report, staffing recommendations, and a 7-day cash flow projection.
5.  Demonstrate the feedback loop functions (model retraining, waste logging).
